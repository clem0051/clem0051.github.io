		<h2 style="text-align:center">About Me</h2>
		<p style="display:inline; text-align:center;">
		I am Jared Clements,the creator of this
		website. A little bit about me, I am the eldest child of 3. I am from Holmen Wisconsin. I am Senior at the University of Saint
		Thomas studying Computer Science, Philosophy, and Catholic Studies. I am also a seminarian
		studying at Saint John Vianney Seminary. My sister, Jenna, is studying at Saint Mary's University for
		education. She is a Sophmore. My brother, Jacob, is a Senior in High School at Holmen High School
		(my alma mater). He plans on doing someing in Computer Science as well. My parents, Brian and Sara Clements,
		are taking care of my two younger cousins who now live with us as well.</p>
		<h2 style="text-align:left">Discription of Tools</h2>
		<p style="text-align:left"><b>All Pages:</b> For all the pages, CSS and HTML was used to make the Navigation on the left,
		the header, and the background. These are constant on all the pages.
		</br></br><b>To-Do List:</b> For this page, I used a table to hold the values of the items of the To-Do list.
		To create a new Item, a mix of HTML and Javascript was used to collect all the needed information. LocalStroage is used
		to save data locally for the website so that when you come back to the website, your data will be saved. Checkboxes
		are used for the complete catagory and layered function calls are used to make the remove button work properly.
		</br></br><b>Photo Gallery:</b> For this page, I used a table to hold thumnails of all the images that are styled with CSS Sheets.
		Upon clicking on the images, a lightbox is created. This is done by using CSS Style Sheets, Javascript, and the use of Div's from HTML.
		The thumbnails are created by a table that spans across the bottom. Upon clicking on the thumbnails, the large image is changed to the
		appropriate image. The left right arrows along with the left and right arrow keys rotate the images. The play button plays a slideshow
		that is ran by javascript. Pressing the ESC button or clicking on the X in the upper righthand corner exits out of the lightbox.
		</br></br><b>Bio Page:</b> Here, the use of CSS Style Sheets and HTML create the whole page. The video is embeded.
